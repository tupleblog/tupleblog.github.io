## About Tuple

Tuple was created by two friends who met in Thailand including Tul and My. Tul obtained his biology degree from Kasetsart University, Thailand. He is now pursuing his master degree at Mahidol University. My obtained his BEng in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. He is now pursuing his master degree in Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. See more in his [personal website](http://titipata.github.io). Both share similar interest in many stuffs. They finally decided to create a blog that can be a place to share their interest to others. As a result, Tuple is created to spread their words through the blog including technology, programming, nature and a little bit of traveling. Tuple is welcome for few more people who who want to join and the blog.
