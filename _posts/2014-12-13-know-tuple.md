### Hello Tuple Blog!

Hi folks! Me ([@titipat_a](https://twitter.com/titipat_a)) and [@t_bluenex](http://twitter.com/t_bluenex) were friends where we met at Mahidol University. I was there visiting the lab. By that time, I worked besides him and we became good friend afterward along with Zaw who was a master student in Biomedical Engineering at Mahidol also. A year later, I came to study in US at Department of Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University. However, I was chatting with Tul and got the inspiration to create our own blog hosting through Github in order to add stuffs that we are interested in including technology, gadget, coding and a little bit of traveling. So here we are the first post of our website! For those who are interested in contributing, feel free to contribute at [https://github.com/tupleblog/tupleblog.github.io](https://github.com/tupleblog/tupleblog.github.io). Or just simply ask us if you want to put some works on the site, we can do it for you too.

### Why named Tuple?

We use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for coding and we are a fan of [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). Tuple is one type of python object. We thought this is a pretty good name and it indicates our shared interest so we chose this name for our blog.
